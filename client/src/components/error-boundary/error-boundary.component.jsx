            This Page is Lost in Space You thought this mission to the moon
            would be a quick six month thing. Your neighbor offered to look
            after your dog. Your high school math teacher was impressed. He once
            said you wouldnâ€™t amount to anything.You sure showed him. But now
            here you are, fifty feet from your spaceship with no way to get
            back. Your dog will be so sad. Your math teacher will be so smug.
            Pretty devastating.
